                    In the fictional universe of Marvel, Wolverine has regenerative powers that can heal any wound, no
                    matter how mortal it is, in addition that same power makes him immune to any disease on Earth and
                    some extraterrestrials. He also possesses superhuman strength, which while not comparable to that of
                    other superheroes like the Hulk, does surpass that of any human.
